Create a mini Web App that displays the current token price.
You should use ReactJS with NextJS and a redux state. To fetch the price of BTC you can use the Coindesk API (https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json).
The price should be stored in the Redux state and regularly updated.
Focus on good project structure and information flow.
Goals:
Create new NextJS app
Use RactJS
Use Redux state
Fetch BTC price
Display BTC price on a page

Bonus points:
Use Docker for deployment
Display the price of multiple tokens
Use .scss for styling
